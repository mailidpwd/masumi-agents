## Required Assets

1. **icon.png** (1024x1024px)
   - App icon for iOS and Android
   - Should be square with no transparency

2. **splash.png** (1242x2436px recommended)

## Quick Setup

You can generate these assets using:

- Or manually create them in your preferred image editor

For development purposes, you can use placeholder images, but for production you'll want proper branded assets.
